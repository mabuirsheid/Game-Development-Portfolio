This repository contains games that I've developed, some of which I developed during my time as an Undergraduate CIT student at RIT, other's I've developed in my own time after graduating.

1. Silent Strings: My most recent and biggest project in scope, It's a Top-down action shooter game inspired by Hotline Miami and developed in Unity 2D.
Narrative:
Axel Voss is a DJ at a gritty underground club in the heart of the city. His life takes a dark turn when his mentor and best friend, Dante Cruz, is murdered under mysterious circumstances. Dante was the one who helped Axel rise from the depths of the streets, teaching him to channel his art and guiding him to success. Left with nothing, Axel embarks on a mission to uncover the truth behind Dante’s death. As Axel dives deeper into the city’s dark underbelly, he discovers a web of corruption, betrayal, and violence. With no support from the authorities, he relies on his underground connections and DJ skills to navigate this dangerous world. Axel has a choice: He can either stay calm, carefully spotting the people responsible and gathering the necessary intel to take them down, or he can go bloodthirsty, tearing through the city in a chaotic, violent pursuit of vengeance. The choices Axel makes will shape the outcome, ultimately revealing a terrifying conspiracy and a hidden truth about Dante’s murder that could change his life forever.

2. Other Projects: A folder where I placed small games that I've developed as practice since my background in Game Development is limited.

Due to file size limitations on Github, I've uploaded necessary files only rather than entire projects.
