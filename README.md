About Me

I'm a BS in Computing and Information Technologies (CIT) graduate from RIT, with a solid foundation in programming and software development. While my formal education gave me technical knowledge, I've recently focused on learning game development to transition into creating interactive experiences. These small games reflect my journey as I work to combine my programming skills with my passion for game development.

This portfolio is a showcase of my work as I continue to learn game development. With a BS in Computing and Information Technologies (CIT), I’ve got a solid programming background, but recently I’ve been focusing on game development as a way to combine technical skills with creativity.
I’m still in the learning process, so not everything here is perfect. Some of the projects are simple practice games, while others like 'Silent Strings' are more ambitious and reflect my current skills.
The purpose of this portfolio is to show my progress and the different areas I’m working to improve in, whether it’s coding, mechanics, or game design.

This repository presently contains "Silent Strings, Bounce Square", "Dodge Dot", and "Simple Shooter."

1. Silent Strings: My most recent and biggest project in scope, It's a Top-down action shooter game inspired by Hotline Miami and developed in Unity 2D.

Narrative:

Axel Voss is a DJ at a gritty underground club in the heart of the city. His life takes a dark turn when his mentor and best friend, Dante Cruz, is murdered under mysterious circumstances. Dante was the one who helped Axel rise from the depths of the streets, teaching him to channel his art and guiding him to success. Left with nothing, Axel embarks on a mission to uncover the truth behind Dante’s death. As Axel dives deeper into the city’s dark underbelly, he discovers a web of corruption, betrayal, and violence. With no support from the authorities, he relies on his underground connections and DJ skills to navigate this dangerous world. Axel has a choice: He can either stay calm, carefully spotting the people responsible and gathering the necessary intel to take them down, or he can go bloodthirsty, tearing through the city in a chaotic, violent pursuit of vengeance. The choices Axel makes will shape the outcome, ultimately revealing a terrifying conspiracy and a hidden truth about Dante’s murder that could change his life forever.


2. Other Projects: A folder where I placed small games that I've developed as practice since my background in Game Development is limited. These single-file practice games helped me strengthen my skills in Unity, specifically in movement, collision detection, spawning systems, and basic game mechanics.

- Bounce Square: A simple game where you control a bouncing square that avoids walls and collects power-ups for points. From this project, I learned how to implement basic movement, collision detection, and create power-up systems within Unity.
- Dodge Dot: In this game, you control a small dot that must dodge falling enemies. It helped me understand enemy spawning, difficulty scaling, and basic collision detection, as well as player movement mechanics.
- Simple Shooter: A top-down shooter where you control a spaceship and shoot enemies. This project gave me experience with implementing projectile mechanics, enemy AI, and spawning systems. It was key to understanding the basics of top-down shooter games in order to start "Silent Strings".

Due to file size limitations on Github, I've uploaded necessary files only rather than entire projects. That includes scripts, assets, and animations.
